/**
 * In OpenMRS, data are rarely fully deleted (purged) from the system; rather, they are either
 * voided or retired. When data can be removed (effectively deleted from the user's perspective),
 * then they are voidable. Voided data are no longer valid and references from other non-voided data
 * are not valid. For example, when duplicate patient records are merged, the record that is not
 * kept is voided (invalidated). Unlike {@link Retireable}, voiding data invalidates any data
 * referencing them. e.g., when a patient is voided, all observations for that patient must be
 * voided as well.
