/**
 * In OpenMRS, data are rarely fully deleted (purged) from the system; rather, they are either
 * voided or retired. When existing data remain valid but should no longer be used for new entries,
 * they are <em>retired</em>. Typically this applies to metadata (see {@link OpenmrsMetadata}). For
 * example, an encounter form type or a patient attribute type may no longer be valid but cannot be
 * removed because there are (and may be in perpetuity) data previously collected using these
 * metadata. Making these metadata Retirable allows them to be retired, meaning that existing
 * references remain valid but future references are not allowed.
