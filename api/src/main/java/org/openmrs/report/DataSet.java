/**
 * Implementations of this interface represent the equivalent of a spreadsheet of data, i.e. columns
 * and rows. Typically subclasses will implement DataSet<Object>, but if all the cells in a table
 * have the same datatype, the subclass could implement DataSet<ThatType>, like for example
 * {@link CohortDataSet}. This is one of three interfaces that work together to define and evaluate
 * an OpenMRS DataSet. You need to implement all three of DataSetProvider, {@link DataSetDefinition}
 * , and {@link DataSet} in order to get useful behavior. For example:
 * {@link RowPerObsDataSetProvider}, {@link RowPerObsDataSetDefinition}, and
 * {@link RowPerObsDataSet} The metadata that describes what data will be produced is defined in
 * {@link DataSetDefinition} The logic that evaluates that metadata goes in an implementation of
 * {@link DataSetProvider}. After evaluation, the data is represented by an implementation of this
 * interface.
 * 
 * @see DataSetProvider
 * @see DataSetDefinition
 * @deprecated see reportingcompatibility module
