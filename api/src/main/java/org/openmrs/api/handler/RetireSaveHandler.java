 * other required values (like dateRetired and retiredBy) are filled in. It also makes sure the
 * retired attributes are cleared out if the retired bit is set to false. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * The {@link RequiredDataAdvice} class uses AOP around each method in every service to check to see
 * if its a save* method. If it is a save* method, and the object being saved implements
 * {@link Retireable}, this class is called to handle setting the
 * {@link Retireable#setRetiredBy(User)}, and {@link Retireable#setDateRetired(Date)} if not set
 * already. <br/>

 * Note: The {@link RequiredDataAdvice} class will loop over child collections on this
 * {@link Retireable} that are themselves a {@link Retireable} and retiredBy/dateRetired are set,
 * but <b>ONLY IF</b> the retired bit was set on them as well. Using the associated retire* method
 * in the service on the parent instance is preferred so that all child objects are indeed retired.
