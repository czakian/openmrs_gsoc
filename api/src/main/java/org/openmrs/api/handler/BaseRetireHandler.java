/**
 * This is the default class for all retire* actions that take place on all services. The
 * {@link RequiredDataAdvice} class uses AOP around each method in every service to check to see if
 * its a retire* method. If it is a retire* method, this class is called to handle setting the
 * {@link Retireable#isRetired()}, {@link Retireable#setRetireReason(String)},
 * {@link Retireable#setRetiredBy(User)}, and {@link Retireable#setDateRetired(Date)}. <br/>
 * <br/>
 * Child collections on this {@link Retireable} that are themselves a {@link Retireable} are looped
 * over and also retired by the {@link RequiredDataAdvice} class.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * This class will only set the retiredBy and dateRetired attributes if retired is set to false. If
 * retired is set to true it is assumed that this object is in a list of things that is getting
 * retired but that it itself was previously retired. The workaround to this is that if the retired
 * bit is true OR the retiredBy is null, the retiredBy, dateRetired, and retireReason will be set.
