This OpenMRSFormatter.xml should match up with the type of formatting used in the .settings file.  If you change this file,
then you should also change the .settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs file.  Also see http://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Coding+Conventions

The formatting done with the .settings is used with Eclipse's control-shift-f.

The .xml file in this folder is used when compiling openmrs with maven.
