<p>
The primary OpenMRS API interfaces. These services provide the necessary methods to access and 
manipulate OpenMRS domain objects.
</p>
<p>
Services are obtained from a org.openmrs.api.context.Context (@see org.openmrs.api.context.Context).
</p>
<p>
These services compose the OpenMRS business layer API. The majority of developer interaction with the
OpenMRS system should occur through these services.&nbsp; Lower level (database) API methods are 
reflected within these services so that	business logic hooks may be placed in front of the database 
layer. Developers should favor calling these services for database access, rather than going directly 
to the DAO objects in the <code>org.openmrs.api.db</code> package.
</p>
<p>
For example:
<pre>
  Context context = ContextFactory.getContext();
  PatientService ps = context.getPatientService();

  // fetch patient with identifier 3-4
  Patient patient = ps.getPatientByIdentifier("3-4");
</pre>
</p>
